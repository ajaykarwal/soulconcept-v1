Hello... I'm Ajay, aka Soul Concept. I'm a Drum and Bass DJ/Producer from Buckingham, UK.
<img src="avatar.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-4 w-25 rounded-3" alt="Ajay Karwal aka Soul Concept" />

I've been DJing since around 1996 and have played all sorts of styles over the years.. Hiphop, UK Garage, Bhangra, Pop, House and of course Drum and Bass... These days I produce and play mainly liquid / soulful / atmospheric Drum and Bass.

My influences include Calibre, Makoto, Zero T, Lenzman, LTJ Bukem, Redeyes, Alix Perez, Krust, DJ Marky and a pretty much the whole of the liquid funk DnB scene. I got into DnB after hearing DJ Krust's "Warhead". That deep single bass note in the intro had me hooked.

Check out the links below to learn more about me and my music.
